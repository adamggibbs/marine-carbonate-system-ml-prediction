# Neural Network pH Estimation Framework

This GitHub page is currently being updated. Code is still to be added.

The objective of this project is to extend on the work of Bitting et al (2018) and improve on the CANYON-B algorithm that estimates pH. We've created a flexible framework to create and train a neural network to predict pH from date, location, temperature, pressure, salinity, and oxygen inputs. This framework allows a user to input training and testing data into folders and create their own neural network using the provided Google Colab notebooks. The intention is to allow oceanographers to be able to create regional algorithms to improve accuracy in the specific area of their study.

# Marine Carbonate System Machine Learning Prediction Algorithm

The objective of this project is to extend on the work of Bitting et al (2018) and improve on the CANYON-B algorithm that predicts parameters of the marine carbonate system. We're looking to develop an empirical algorithm that can predict pH, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and saturation state from easier to measure ocean parameters: time, location, pressure, temperature, salinity, and oxygen.
